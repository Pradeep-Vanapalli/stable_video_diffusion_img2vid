# stable_video_diffusion_img2vid
* We can generate the videos by giving the image as an input. It generates the 20-24 frames and combine them to generate the video.
* Stable Diffusion Video:
	- Euler EDM Sampler:
		* EDM -  Explicit Descrete Method
	   * This is the sample techinique and used in compuatational mathematics.
		 * Sampling depends on quality and diversity of image generated.
		- Where it helps:
			 1. Navigating the latent space
			 2. Handling Stochasticity - randomness
				 * Image generated based on the Random sampling.
			 3. Improving Diversity to generate quality image.
			 4. Temperature Control
